     <section class="about"><h1>Research</h1>
        <div><p>In Ellen’s second and third year at UWEC, she acted as a Research Assistant for the UWEC Geography department. During this research, Ellen worked along side UWEC faculty, Dr. Jol and Martin Goettl, five UWEC undergraduates, and Dr. Reeder from Douscane University in finding mass Holocaust graves with ground penetrating radar (GPR) in Latvia and Lithuania. </p>
<p>In the months leading up to the international field research, Ellen spent time analyzing past research, learning the history of Latvia and Lithuania, and practiced using the tools and software. During summer 2024, the research team visited 12 locations throughout the Baltic States that potentially showed evidence of the horrors that the Solviates and Nazis covered up during WWII. Along with conducting field research, Ellen interviewed community members, worked with in country sponcers, and induldged in the countries history. </p>
<p>In Ellen’s 3rd year, she analyzed data from a site that used to be titled Jungfernhof. Today is a public park, but during 1941-1943, the site was one of the first concentration camps in Latvia. Ellen then went on to present her data at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR) and at Celebration of Excellence in Research + Creative Activity (CERCA). </p>     </div>
